            <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
                <p class="aboutTextOne"> Hello everyone, and thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio. My name is Spencer. I live in Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, and I'm a 2nd year Information Technology (IT) Generalist student at the NSCC Institute of Technology Campus located in Halifax. My main motivation for choosing the IT Generalist program was to incorporate my life long interest in computers, and turning it into a long-term career. I have been given many opportunities to improve on my skillset in all areas of IT throughout the 2 year program. Whether it's in programming, databases, web development, and so on. With that said, I am looking forward to learning new things as I proceed with my career in IT. I can't wait to see what's in store for me!
                </p>
                <p class="aboutTextOne"> Previously, I attended the NSCC's Waterfront (now Ivany) campus for the 2015-2016 school year to take Office Administration, and graduated with a certificate.
                </p> 
                <p class="aboutTextOne">To demonstrate some of the work I've accomplished, I have provided some <a href="worksamples.html"> work samples </a> on my webpage to showcase. These are pieces of work that demonstrate my challenges, my overall growth as an IT student, and work that I feel the most proud in. 
                </p>
                <p class="aboutTextOne"> Should you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to visit my <a href="contact.html"> contact page.
