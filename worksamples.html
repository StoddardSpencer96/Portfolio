			<!-- VEX MONSTERS -->
			<h3 class="vexMonstersHeader"> Vex Monsters - Unity and C# </h3>
				<img src="img/Vex.PNG" id="vexMonsters" alt="Vex Monsters">
				<p class="vexMonstersDescription"> Vex Monsters is a 2D video game that's currently being developed in Unity using C#. I'm currently working alongside a team of 3 (myself included). This is a project that started out as a Capstone project to fulfill one of the requirements for graduation, and has now evolved into a side project to work on in our free time. </p> 
				<p class="vexMonstersDescription"> Overall, this project gave me exposure to Unity for the first time, and since then, I've learned lots of valuable things about game development. This project also allowed me to improve even more on my C# skills after being exposed to it in my previous semester (work sample from that class is down below!) and made me enjoy the language even more. </p>
			<!-- IT JOB FAIR -->
			<h3 class="jobFairHeader"> IT Job Fair Website - Project Blackbird (Work Term) </h3>
				<img src="img/jobFair.JPG" id="jobFairSite" alt="Job Fair Website">
				<img src="img/jobFairTwo.JPG" id="jobFairSiteTwo" alt="Job Fair Website Two">
				<p class="jobFairDescription"> This was a 5 week work term during my 1st year as an IT Generalist student. I worked on the front-end with a team of 4 to create, design, and develop a website for the annual IT Job Fair. We used Bootstrap as our front-end framework with some JavaScript. The back-end at the time only used pure PHP, but has since evolved to using the Laravel framework. </p>
				<p class="jobFairDescription"> Overall, I had an amazing time working on the site and working with the rest of the team. It was a great way to apply the skills that I already knew at the time without feeling overburdened, and was a great way for me to meet new people and to be able to collaborate with them.

            <!-- C++ CONVERSION -->

                <img src="img/conversionAfter.jpg" id="conversionAfter" alt="After Conversion">
                <p class="conversionDescription"> This was our 4th and final assignment in our C++ class. This reads in a C++ file via user input, and converts it into an HTML file. There were some rules we had to follow. The user had to input the file they wish to convert (in this case, the CPP file), and had to name what the output file was going to be (ex: CPPTwo). As the file was being read, if there was a less than symbol (&lt;), or a greater than symbol (&gt;), we had to change it to "& lt;" and "& gt;" respectfully. In addition, there needed to be a "PRE" tag at the beginning and end of the file respectfully. </p>
                <p class="conversionDescription"> I remember having a rough time getting started with the assignment as I was overthinking it way too much. Once I figured out where to start, and broke things down into smaller tasks, it was smooth sailings from there. Overall, I was pleased with the result, and demonstrates how far I've come in programming over the 2 years I spent at the NSCC. </p>

                <p class="dataA1Description"> This was our second assignment in our Data Driven Application Programming course using C#. We were tasked to build upon a database that we created from our first assignment, and to give it a user interface that composed of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) actions. I recall having a tough time with the Create aspect of the assignment, and spent hours attempting to figure out why it wouldn't work. Despite this not being my best result, this assignment is a good reminder for me to troubleshoot a little more effectively for any future projects. Despite the difficulties, I felt rather confident in the work I accomplished up to this point.

			<!-- PHASER 3 GAMES -->
			<h3 class="phaserHeader"> Phaser Games - JavaScript</h3>
				<p class="phaserDescription"> The following are 3 web-based games that I built in my JavaScript Game Programmming class. These games were created using JavaScript, and Phaser 3. They're all score-based games where the objective is to get the highest score possible without hitting any of the obstacles that would result in game being over. Feel free to play them! They can run within your browser, and the game will open in a new tab.</p>

                <p class="collegeAppDescription">
                    This was our second assignment in our Intro to Object-Oriented Programming course using Java. We were tasked to take in either the name of the student or staff (whichever the user chose), and had to input some details such as their address, the years they've been in college, etc. Even though this program is not 100% functional, I recall having difficulties with the first Java assignment, and made it a priority to do a better job for this assignment. I made sure to push through, and to give it my best effort.
